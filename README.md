## Introduction


In this code, i built a Complex Expense Budget Tracker. While building it, i used many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them are State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI, and how to create a scalable React folder structure. But most importantly, i added voice capabilities to my applications using Speechly.
